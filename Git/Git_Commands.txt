Git:    
        Git is basically a version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. 
        It is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git Advantages:
        We can commit changes frequently to repositories. In case of a system crash, the amount of lost work is minimized as the repository holds recent changes.
        We can work on separate branches, reducing the risk of corrupting the main codebase.
        We can create branches for new features, bug fixes, or experiments.

Git Commands:
        1) $ git init -->   
        This command initializes a new repository, setting up the necessary files and directories to start tracking changes in your project.

Git LFS:
Git Large File Storage is an extension to Git that allows you to manage and version large files efficiently. 
Instead of storing the actual large file content, It stores pointers to the large files in your repository while keeping the large file content in a separate storage.
How to use -->
                git lfs install
                git lfs track "<file-extension>
                git add .gitattributes
                git commit -m "commit message>
                git push
Implementation -->
                git lfs install
                git lfs track "*.png" 
                git add .gitattributes
                git commit -m "Track large png files using Git LFS"
                git push


SSH key Generation:
SSH keys is essential for secure authentication with remote servers, Git repositories, and other services.
