Ruby is a scripting language designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known as Matz. 
It runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX.

* Ruby is a pure object-oriented programming language.
* Ruby is an open-source and is freely available on the Web, but it is subject to a license.
* Ruby is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language.
* Ruby is a server-side scripting language similar to Python and PERL.
* Ruby can be used to write Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts.
* Ruby can be embedded into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
* Ruby has a clean and easy syntax that allows a new developer to learn very quickly and easily.
* Ruby is very much scalable and big programs written in Ruby are easily maintainable.
* Ruby has similar syntax to that of many programming languages such as C++ and Perl.
* Ruby can be used for developing Internet and intranet applications.
* Ruby can be installed in Windows and POSIX environments.
* Ruby can easily be connected to DB2, MySQL, Oracle, and Sybase.
* Ruby has a rich set of built-in functions, which can be used directly into Ruby scripts.
* Ruby support many GUI tools such as Tcl/Tk, GTK, and OpenGL.


FEATURES OF RUBY:-
Ruby has many reasons for being popular and in demand. Few of the reasons are mentioned below:
 
1) The code written in Ruby is small, elegant and powerful as it has fewer number of lines of code.
2) Ruby allows simple and fast creation of Web application which results in less hard work.
3) As Ruby is free of charge that is Ruby is free to copy, use, modify, it allow programmers to make necessary changes as and when required.
4) Ruby is a dynamic programming language due to which there is no tough rules on how to built in features and it is very close to spoken languages.

# Ruby BEGIN Statement
   Declares code to be called before the program is run.
   Syntax:  BEGIN {
                code
            }

        Example:    puts "Hello, Nishchay Gupta." 
                    BEGIN {
                        puts "This is Ruby Learning!"
                    }  

        Output: This is Ruby Learning!
                Hello, Nishchay Gupta.



# Ruby END Statement
    Declares code to be called at the end of the program.   
    Syntax: END {
                code
            }

        Example:    puts "Hello, Nishchay Gupta." 
                    END {
                        puts "Completed Ruby Learning!"
                    }

        Output: Hello, Nishchay Gupta.
                Completed Ruby Learning!



# Ruby Comments
    A comment hides a line, part of a line, or several lines from the Ruby interpreter.

    SingleLined:   # I am a comment. Just ignore me.

    MultiLined:   =begin
                  This is a comment.
                  This is a comment, too.
                  This is a comment, too.
                  I said that already.
                  =end  
    


# Variables
    There are different types of variables in Ruby:
				1) Local variables:
						- A local variable name always starts with a lowercase letter(a-z) or underscore (_). 
						- These variables are local to the code construct in which they are declared.
						- A local variable is only accessible within the block of its initialization. 
						- Local variables are not available outside the method. 
						- There is no need to initialize the local variables.
						Example: age = 10
										 _Age = 20


				2) Instance variables:
						- An instance variable name always starts with a @ sign. 
						- They are similar to Class variables but their values are local to specific instances of an object. 
						- Instance variables are available across methods for any specified instance or object i.e. instance variables can change from object to object.
						- There is no need to initialize the instance variables and uninitialized instance variable always contains a nil value.
						Example: 
							class Customer
   							def initialize(id, name, addr)
      						@cust_id = id
      						@cust_name = name
      						@cust_addr = addr
   							end
  						 def display_details()
      						puts "Customer id #@cust_id"
      						puts "Customer name #@cust_name"
      						puts "Customer address #@cust_addr"
   									end
								end

								cust1 = Customer.new("1", "John", "Wisdom Apartments, Ludhiya")
								cust2 = Customer.new("2", "Poul", "New Empire road, Khandala")

										cust1.display_details()
										cust2.display_details()


				3) Class variables:
						- A class variable name always starts with @@ sign.
						- It is available across different objects.
						- A class variable belongs to the class and it is a characteristic of a class. 
						- They need to be initialized before use.
						- Another way of thinking about class variables is as global variables within the context of a single class. 
						- A class variable is shared by all the descendants of the class. 
						- An uninitialized class variable will result in an error.
						Example: 
							class Customer 
								@@no_of_customers = 0

								def initialize(id, name, addr)  
									@cust_id = id 
									@cust_name = name 
									@cust_addr = addr 
								end
 
								def display_details() 
									puts "Customer id #@cust_id"
									puts "Customer name #@cust_name"
									puts "Customer address #@cust_addr"
								end

								def total_no_of_customers() 
									@@no_of_customers += 1
									puts "Total number of customers: #@@no_of_customers"
								end
							end

							cust1 = Customer.new("1", "John", "Wisdom Apartments, Ludhiya") 
							cust2 = Customer.new("2", "Poul", "New Empire road, Khandala") 

							cust1.display_details() 
							cust1.total_no_of_customers() 
							cust2.display_details() 
							cust2.total_no_of_customers() 


				4) Global variables :
						- A global variable name always starts with $. 
						- Class variables are not available across classes. 
						- If you want to have a single variable, which is available across classes, you need to define a global variable. 
						- Its scope is global, means it can be accessed from anywhere in a program. 
						- By default, an uninitialized global variable has a nil value and its use can cause the programs to be cryptic and complex.
						Example: 							
							$global_variable = 10
							class Class1 
								def print_global 
									puts "Global variable in Class1 is #$global_variable"
								end
							end
							class Class2 
								def print_global 
									puts "Global variable in Class2 is #$global_variable"
									end
								end
							class1obj = Class1.new
							class1obj.print_global 
							class2obj = Class2.new
							class2obj.print_global 



# Operators
	Ruby supports a rich set of operators, as you'd expect from a modern language. 
	Most operators are actually method calls		

	1)  Arithmetic Operators:-

			a) + operator: (Addition) − Adds values on either side of the operator.
				 Example:- 	a + b will give 30

			b) - operator: (Subtraction0 − Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.
				 Example:- a - b will give -10	

			c) * operator: (Multiplication) − Multiplies values on either side of the operator.
				 Example:- a * b will give 200	

			d) / operator: (Division) − Divides left hand operand by right hand operand.
				 Example:- b / a will give 2

			e) % operator: (Modulus) − Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder.
				 Example:- b % a will give 0	

			f) **	operator: (Exponent) − Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators. 					
				 Example:- a**b will give 10 to the power 20	


	2) Comparison Operators

 			a) == operator: Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
				Example: (a == b) is not true.

			b) != operator: Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if values are not equal then condition becomes true.
				Example: (a != b) is true.

			c) > operator: Checks if the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
				Example: (a > b) is not true.

			d) < operator: Checks if the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
				Example: (a < b) is true.

			e) >= operator: Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
				Example: (a >= b) is not true.

			f) <= operator: Checks if the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.
				Example: (a <= b) is true.

			g) <=> operator: Combined comparison operator. Returns 0 if first operand equals second, 1 if first operand is greater than the second and -1 if first operand is less than the second.
				Example: (a <=> b) returns -1.

			h) === operator: Used to test equality within a when clause of a case statement.
				Example: (1...10) === 5 returns true.

			i) .eql? operator: True if the receiver and argument have both the same type and equal values.
				Example: 1 == 1.0 returns true, but 1.eql?(1.0) is false.

			j) equal?	operator: True if the receiver and argument have the same object id.					
				Example: if aObj is duplicate of bObj then aObj == bObj is true, a.equal?bObj is false but a.equal?aObj is true.


	3) Assignment Operators

			a) = operator: (Simple assignment operator), assigns values from right side operands to left side operand.
				Example: c = a + b will assign the value of a + b into c

			b) += operator: (Add AND assignment operator) adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand.
				Example: 	c += a is equivalent to c = c + a
				
			c) -= operator: (Subtract AND assignment operator), subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand
				Example: c -= a is equivalent to c = c - a
				
			d) *= operator: (Multiply AND assignment operator), multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand.
				Example: c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a
				
			e) /= operator: (Divide AND assignment operator), divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand.
				Example: c /= a is equivalent to c = c / a
				
			f) %= operator: (Modulus AND assignment operator), takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand.
				Example: c %= a is equivalent to c = c % a
			
			g) **= operator: (Exponent AND assignment operator), performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand.
				Example: c **= a is equivalent to c = c ** a


	4) Bitwise Operators

			a) & operator: 	(Binary AND Operator) copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.
				Example: (a & b) will give 12, which is 0000 1100
 
			b) | operator: (Binary OR Operator) copies a bit if it exists in either operand.
				Example: (a | b) will give 61, which is 0011 1101
 
			c) ^ operator: (Binary XOR Operator) copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
				Example: (a ^ b) will give 49, which is 0011 0001
 
			d) ~ operator: (Binary Ones Complement Operator) is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
				Example: (~a ) will give -61, which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.
 
			e) << operator: (Binary Left Shift Operator). The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
				Example: a << 2 will give 240, which is 1111 0000
 
			f) >> operator: (Binary Right Shift Operator). The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
				Example: a >> 2 will give 15, which is 0000 1111

	
	5) Logical Operators
			a) and operator: Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are true, then the condition becomes true.
							Example: (a and b) is true.

			b) or operator: Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non zero, then the condition becomes true.
							Example: (a or b) is true.
				
			c) && operator: Called Logical AND operator. If both the operands are non zero, then the condition becomes true.
							Example: (a && b) is true.
				
			d) || operator: Called Logical OR Operator. If any of the two operands are non zero, then the condition becomes true.
							Example: (a || b) is true.
				
			e) ! operator: Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false.
							Example: !(a && b) is false.
				
			f) not operator: Called Logical NOT Operator. Use to reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then Logical NOT operator will make false.
							Example: not(a && b) is false.
				
 
	6) Ternary Operator
			 ?: operator: 
			 	Example: If Condition is true ? Then value X : Otherwise value Y


	7) Range Operators
			.. operator: Creates a range from start point to end point inclusive.
				Example: 1..10 Creates a range from 1 to 10 inclusive.

			... operator: Creates a range from start point to end point exclusive.
				Example: 1...10 Creates a range from 1 to 9.
